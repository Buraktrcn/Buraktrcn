# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me:

</br>
Hello, I'm Burak. I'm a software developer with 2 years of experience in Flutter development. Among my areas of expertise are state management and application architectures such as MVVM, Provider, BLoC, MobX, and GetX. During the project development process, I can successfully implement these technologies to create robust and effective code architectures. Additionally, I have extensive experience in developing and managing applications using the Firebase platform. I can communicate with RESTful APIs using packages like Dio and HTTP in Flutter by sending requests. This enables applications to interact with external resources (such as servers) and perform data exchange. I enjoy working on innovative projects and developing user-friendly, performance-focused applications. I'm good at working in teams, with a collaborative nature. I am also constantly open to learning about new technologies and advancements.
